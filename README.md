# todo-cli
A command line to-do list application.<br /><br />
Todo-list previously was not purely a cli tool that fully integrated on the terminal.<br />
So this project is a continue up development from my class assignment, in order to make it functional enough to be my daily app.<br /><br />
Hopes this is fun :), I want to learn more in cli development.
