# todo-cli
A command line to-do list application.
I didn't know about cli apps when I first wrote my todo-list app that only runs through a directory which makes it look like a cli tool but it's not fully integrated on the terminal. This is the updated version of todo-list and I'll try to learn on how to develop a cli tool throughout the process. Hopes it fun :)
